We aren't currently managing the apps through clasp. But this could be a future improvement to better manage code for this project.

Refer to the documentation [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Paj9S_m51L5W8HlcYM5y0XRe1BPSWeYBs0KUabXvaM/edit#) for additional details on how to integrate these google scripts with Twilio Studio to standup a low cost and effective survey system.
